//Loops Exercise 1: Counting
//Use a for loop to log the numbers 1- 10.​
//Modify the for loop so that it counts down from 10 to 1.



//Loops Exercise 2: Tasks
//Create an array, called tasks, of 3 or more household tasks you need to do.​
//Use a for loop and template literals to iterate through the array printing `Task ${I+1}: ${tasks[i]}` for each element on the array.




//Loops Exercise 3: Last Loop Value
//Which value is the last to be alerted in this code?​
//let i = 3;​
//while (i) 
//{​
//  alert( i-- );​
//}




//Loops Exercise 4: Even Numbers
//Use a for loop to output even numbers from “2” to “10”.



//Loops Exercise 5: Replace “for”
//Rewrite the code below, changing the “for” loop to a “while” loop without altering the behaviour of the loop.​
//for ( let x = 0; x < 3; x++ ) 
//{​
//  alert( `number ${x}!` );​   
//}



//Loops Exercise 6: Sum
//Write a function “sumInput()” that:​
//Take in an array of numbers as a parameter​
